**Changelog
* Rev 3 - beta release
  
**Parts List**
* Three printed parts
* A square of the packing foam from the beepberry box to cushion the battery, about the size of the battery

**Instructions**
* Print face down/back down. Supports are totally optional on the openings.  I had good luck with tree supports as they were easy to remove from delicate spots.
* Remove the top two screws from the pi.  Leave the screws holding it to the pogo pins.
* Trim the foam so it dosen't cover the big chips and put it between the battery and the bcb.
* Orient the battery so it doesn't cross its wire.
* Work the case together starting at the pi end, pressing the corners into the slot, and gently popping it together.  Double theck the battery position and don't force it. It's better to trim the plastic somewhere than break something.
* That's it!
  
Cut the foam around the big chips so airflow isn't blocked for them:
